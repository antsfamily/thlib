        Linear 1D interpolation linke :func:`numpy.interp` on the GPU for Pyth.
        This function returns interpolated values of a set of 1-D functions at
        the desired query points `xnew`.
        This function is working similarly to Matlabâ„¢ or scipy functions with
        the `linear` interpolation mode on, except that it parallelises over
        any number of desired interpolation problems.
        The code will run on GPU if all the tensors provided are on a cuda
        device.
        Parameters
        ----------
        x : (N, ) or (D, N) Pytorch Tensor
            A 1-D or 2-D tensor of real values.
        y : (N,) or (D, N) Pytorch Tensor
            A 1-D or 2-D tensor of real values. The length of `y` along its
            last dimension must be the same as that of `x`
        xnew : (P,) or (D, P) Pytorch Tensor
            A 1-D or 2-D tensor of real values. `xnew` can only be 1-D if
            _both_ `x` and `y` are 1-D. Otherwise, its length along the first
            dimension must be the same as that of whichever `x` and `y` is 2-D.
        out : Pytorch Tensor, same shape as `xnew`
            Tensor for the output. If None: allocated automatically.

        The algorithm used for interpolation is determined by :attr:`mode`.

        Currently temporal, spatial and volumetric sampling are supported, i.e.
        expected inputs are 3-D, 4-D or 5-D in shape.

        The input dimensions are interpreted in the form:
        `mini-batch x channels x [optional depth] x [optional height] x width`.

        The modes available for resizing are: `nearest`, `linear` (3D-only),
        `bilinear`, `bicubic` (4D-only), `trilinear` (5D-only), `area`

        Args:
            input (Tensor): the input tensor
            size (int or Tuple[int] or Tuple[int, int] or Tuple[int, int, int]):
                output spatial size.
            scale_factor (float or Tuple[float]): multiplier for spatial size. Has to match input size if it is a tuple.
            mode (str): algorithm used for upsampling:
                ``'nearest'`` | ``'linear'`` | ``'bilinear'`` | ``'bicubic'`` |
                ``'trilinear'`` | ``'area'``. Default: ``'nearest'``
            align_corners (bool, optional): Geometrically, we consider the pixels of the
                input and output as squares rather than points.
                If set to ``True``, the input and output tensors are aligned by the
                center points of their corner pixels, preserving the values at the corner pixels.
                If set to ``False``, the input and output tensors are aligned by the corner
                points of their corner pixels, and the interpolation uses edge value padding
                for out-of-boundary values, making this operation *independent* of input size
                when :attr:`scale_factor` is kept the same. This only has an effect when :attr:`mode`
                is ``'linear'``, ``'bilinear'``, ``'bicubic'`` or ``'trilinear'``.
                Default: ``False``
            recompute_scale_factor (bool, optional): recompute the scale_factor for use in the
                interpolation calculation.  When `scale_factor` is passed as a parameter, it is used
                to compute the `output_size`.  If `recompute_scale_factor` is ```False`` or not specified,
                the passed-in `scale_factor` will be used in the interpolation computation.
                Otherwise, a new `scale_factor` will be computed based on the output and input sizes for
                use in the interpolation computation (i.e. the computation will be identical to if the computed
                `output_size` were passed-in explicitly).  Note that when `scale_factor` is floating-point,
                the recomputed scale_factor may differ from the one passed in due to rounding and precision
                issues.

        .. note::
            With ``mode='bicubic'``, it's possible to cause overshoot, in other words it can produce
            negative values or values greater than 255 for images.
            Explicitly call ``result.clamp(min=0, max=255)`` if you want to reduce the overshoot
            when displaying the image.

        .. warning::
            With ``align_corners = True``, the linearly interpolating modes
            (`linear`, `bilinear`, and `trilinear`) don't proportionally align the
            output and input pixels, and thus the output values can depend on the
            input size. This was the default behavior for these modes up to version
            0.3.1. Since then, the default behavior is ``align_corners = False``.
            See :class:`~th.nn.Upsample` for concrete examples on how this
            affects the outputs.

        .. warning::
            When scale_factor is specified, if recompute_scale_factor=True,
            scale_factor is used to compute the output_size which will then
            be used to infer new scales for the interpolation.
            The default behavior for recompute_scale_factor changed to False
            in 1.6.0, and scale_factor is used in the interpolation
            calculation.

        Note:
            When using the CUDA backend, this operation may induce nondeterministic
            behaviour in its backward pass that is not easily switched off.
